About

110 baud, LLC is Todd Karakashian — a software developer and psychiatric nurse practitioner based in Portland, Oregon.

Todd designs and builds AI-based software for mental health care, emphasizing privacy, clinical integrity, and thoughtful human–machine collaboration.

Before entering health care, Todd worked as a software engineer in scientific data management, with roles at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He later joined WebLogic, Inc., a startup developing enterprise systems infrastructure software. WebLogic was acquired by BEA Systems, and later by Oracle, where it became the foundation of Oracle’s WebLogic Server product line.

Through 110 baud, Todd brings his engineering background together with his years of clinical experience to create intelligent, human-centered software that supports clinicians and patients in the delivery of care.
